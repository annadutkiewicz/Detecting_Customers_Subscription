## Detecting_Customers_Subscription
### Description

**The company provides a mobile app which has both free and paid version of the product. The aim is to predict which users will subscribe to paid membership.**

### Workflow
1. Data import
- Load libraries
- Load dataset
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
2. Data cleaning
- Convert column type
- Remove unnecessary columns
3. Data visualizing
- Plot histogram
4. Correlation with response
5. Correlation matrix
- Compute the correlation matrix
- Generate a mask for the upper triangle
- Draw the heatmap with the mask and correct aspect ratio
6. Feature engineering
- Formatting date columns
- Selecting time for response
- Load top screens
- Mapping screens to fields
- Funnels
7. Data preprocessing
- Splitting independent and response variables
- Splitting the dataset into the training set and test set
- Removing identifiers
- Feature scaling
8. Model building
- Fitting model to the training set
- Predicting test set
- Evaluating results
- Print confusion matrix
- Print heatmap
- Print classification report
- Formatting final results

### Conclusions
1. ABC
